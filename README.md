## Introduction

Efficient parking management is crucial in urban areas due to the rise in vehicles and limited parking spaces. Current methods often use costly hardware and can be inaccurate. This project aims to create a low-cost, robust parking space detection system using computer vision. We explore traditional computer vision techniques and machine learning models to find an accurate and efficient real-time solution. Effective parking management reduces congestion, search time, fuel consumption, and emissions, improving user experience and minimizing environmental impact. Our project offers a scalable solution for existing parking infrastructure.

## Datasets

- **PKLot Dataset:** Contains 12,416 images of parking lots extracted from surveillance camera frames, annotated with bounding boxes indicating whether the parking spot is occupied or not.
- **Custom Parking Dataset:** Created using a live video feed, cropped to obtain 69 x 30 images of occupied and vacant spots. This dataset contains 1605 images of occupied spaces and 400 images of vacant spaces.
- **Live Video Parking Lot Feed:** 1920 x 1080 birdâ€™s eye view feed of a parking lot.

## Conclusion

Despite the CNN's high accuracy, its prediction time per space was impractical for larger parking lots. The traditional computer vision approach was chosen for its efficiency and real-time performance, providing a reliable solution for automated parking management. Future work includes incorporating more diverse datasets and enhancing model robustness to function under different conditions.

  - **Purpose:** Script for setting up and saving the coordinates of parking spaces.
  - **Functionality:** Allows users to define the locations of regular and disabled parking spaces on a static image. The coordinates are saved in a pickle file for later use.

- **ParkingLotConfigure2.py**
  - **Purpose:** An alternative version of the parking lot configuration script.
  - **Functionality:** Similar to ParkingLotConfigure.py, but utilizes a different pickle file.

- **CarClassifier.ipynb**
  - **Purpose:** Jupyter notebook for training the parking space classifier model.
